1. Run `bash get_data.sh` to get all the data you need.
2. Implement `data.py`, `main.py`, `engine.py` and `model.py`
3. GLHF with running experiments with different models and configurations and tuning hyperparameters :)

# Please READ
Note: we've provided some logs that we ran to help you perform some sanity checks. In each of the logging directory, info.json provides all the choices we made, and log.txt shows how the model ends up doing. Please do NOT abuse the intention of our sanity check by making Piazza posts saying that if some results are acceptable compared to our results or not. Even if there is little difference, it's acceptable. The most important thing is to convince yourself that your results make sense based on the class material, and the later on convince us by clearly illustrating your model's performance and your thoughts in the report for submission.
